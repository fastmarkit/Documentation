With the REST API, you can send commands to Misty from a REST client or browser. There is also a community owned [Python wrapper](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Wrapper-Python) available for the Misty REST API.

To create skills for Misty, you'll need to send commands to Misty and get data back from Misty. To send commands to Misty, you can call the REST API. To get live updating data back from Misty, you'll need to use a [WebSocket connection](../../build/remote-command-architecture#subscribing-amp-unsubscribing-to-a-websocket). You can visit the [Misty Community Tutorials](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Tutorials) repository for example skills.

**Note:** Not all of Misty's API is equally complete. You may see some commands labeled "Beta" or "Alpha" because the related hardware, firmware, or software is still under development. Feel free to use these commands, but realize they may behave unpredictably at this time.

## URL & Message Formats

Use the following URL format when sending commands to the robot:
```markup
http://<robot-ip-address>/api/<Endpoint>
```
Misty uses JSON to format REST API data. Use this format when creating the payload:
```json
{
  "key0": "value0",
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```
All successful commands return a status and the result of the call:
```json
[
  {
    "result": true,
    "status": "Success"
  }
]
```
If there is an issue, Misty returns an HTTP error code and error message.

## Images & Display

Misty comes with a set of default "eyes" that display onscreen. But we encourage you to get creative and upload your own Misty "eyes" or other images. Misty's chest LED is also configurable.


### ChangeDisplayImage

Displays an image on Misty's screen. Optionally, `ChangeDisplayImage` can display an image for a specific length of time and/or transparently overlay an image on Misty's eyes. Use `SaveImageAssetToRobot` to upload images to Misty.

Note that it's not possible for a custom image to overlay another custom image. Misty's eyes always appear as the base image, behind an overlay.

Endpoint: POST &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/images/change

Parameters
- FileName (string) - Name of the previously uploaded file containing the image to display. Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. Maximum file size is 3MB. To clear the image from the screen, pass an empty string ```""```.
- TimeOutSeconds (double) - Optional. The length of time to display the specified image.
- Alpha (double) - Optional. The transparency of the image. A value of 0 is completely transparent; 1 is completely opaque. When you specify a value greater than 0 and less than 1, the image appears but is transparent, and Misty's eyes appear behind the specified image.

```json
{   
  "FileName": "pink_sunset.jpg",
  "TimeOutSeconds": 5,
  "Alpha": 0.5
}
```


Return Values
* Result (boolean) - Returns `true` if there are no errors related to this command.


### GetListOfImages
Obtains a list of the images currently stored on Misty.

Endpoint: GET &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/images

Parameters
- None

Return Values
* Result (array) - Returns an array containing one element for each image currently stored on Misty. Each element contains the following:
   * Height (integer) - the height of the image file
   * Name (string) - the name of the image file
   * Width (integer) - the width of the image file
   * userAddedAsset (boolean) - If `true`, the file was added by the user. If `false`, the file is one of Misty's system files.

### SaveImageAssetToRobot (Byte Array String)
Saves an image to Misty in the form of a byte array string. Optionally, proportionately reduces the size of the saved image.

Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. Maximum file size is 3 MB.

**Note:** Images can be reduced in size but not enlarged. Because Misty does not adjust the proportions of images, for best results use an image with proportions similar to her screen (480 x 272 pixels).

Endpoint: POST &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/images

Parameters
* FileName (string) - The name of the image file to upload.
* DataAsByteArrayString (string) - The image data, passed as a string containing a byte array.
* Width (integer) - Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image width (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of an image you must supply values for both `Width` and `Height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `Width` and `Height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image. 
* Height (integer) -  Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image height (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of an image you must supply values for both `Width` and `Height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `Width` and `Height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image.
* ImmediatelyApply (boolean) - Optional. A value of `true` tells Misty to immediately display the uploaded image file, while a value of `false` tells  Misty not to display the image.
- OverwriteExisting (boolean) - Optional. A value of `true` indicates the uploaded file should overwrite a file with the same name, if one currently exists on Misty. A value of `false` indicates the uploaded file should not overwrite any existing files on Misty.

```json
{
  "FileName": "example.jpg",
  "DataAsByteArrayString": "30,190,40,24,...",
  "Width": "300",

Parameters

* Base64 (boolean) - Sending a request with `true` returns the image data as a downloadable Base64 string, while sending a request of `false` displays the photo in your browser or REST client immediately after it is taken. Default is `true`.
* FileName (string) - Optional. The filename to assign to the image file for the captured photo. Note that if you do not specify a filename, Misty does not save the photo to her local storage.
* Width (integer) - Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image width (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of a photo you must supply values for both `Width` and `Height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `Width` and `Height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image. 
* Height (integer) -  Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image height (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of a photo you must supply values for both `Width` and `Height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `Width` and `Height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image.
* DisplayOnScreen (boolean) - Optional. If `true` **and** a `FileName` is provided, displays the captured photo on Misty’s screen. If `false` or no `FileName` value is provided, does nothing.
* OverwriteExisting (boolean) - Optional. Indicates whether Misty should overwrite an image with the same filename as the captured photo if one exists on her local storage. Passing in `true` overwrites a file with the same name. Passing in `false` prevents an existing file with the same name from being overwritten. In the case that `OverwriteExisting` is set to `false` and a photo already exists with the same filename as the newly captured photo, the new photo is not saved to Misty. Defaults to `false`.

```json
{
  "Base64": true,
  "FileName": "MyPicture",
  "Width": 300,
  "Height": 200,
  "DisplayOnScreen": true,
  "OverwriteExisting": true
}
```

  * Height (integer) - The height of the image in pixels.
  * Name (string) - The name of the image.  
  * Width (integer) - The width of the image in pixels. 


### SlamGetVisibleImage - ALPHA
Takes a photo using Misty’s Occipital Structure Core depth sensor.

**Important!** Make sure to use `SlamStartStreaming` to open the data stream from Misty's depth sensor before using this command, and use `SlamStopStreaming` to close the data stream after using this command.

Endpoint: GET &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/slam/visibleimage?Base64={bool}

Parameters  
**Note:** Because GET requests do not contain payloads, the parameter for this request must be included in the URL as seen above.
- Base64 (boolean) - Sending a request with `true` returns the image data as a downloadable Base64 string, while sending a request of `false` displays the photo in your browser or REST client immediately after it is taken. Default is `true`. **Note:** Images generated by this command are not saved in Misty's memory. To save an image to your robot for later use, pass `true` for `Base64` to obtain the image data, download the image file, then call `SaveImageAssetToRobot` to upload and save the image to Misty.

Return Values
- Result (object) -  An object containing image data and meta information. This object is only sent if you pass `true` for `Base64`.
    - base64 (string) - A string containing the Base64-encoded image data.
    - format (string) - The type and format of the image returned.
    - height (integer) - The height of the picture in pixels.
    - name (string) - The name of the picture.

  "name": "OccipitalVisibleImage",
  "width": 640.0,
}
```

### SlamGetDepthImage - ALPHA
Provides the current distance of objects from Misty’s Occipital Structure Core depth sensor. Note that depending on the scene being viewed, the sensor may return a large proportion of “unknown” values in the form of `NaN` (“not a number”) values.

**Important!** Make sure to use `SlamStartStreaming` to open the data stream from Misty's depth sensor before using this command, and use `SlamStopStreaming` to close the data stream after using this command.

Endpoint: GET &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/slam/depthimage

Parameters
- None

Return Values
- Result (object) - An object containing depth information about the image matrix, with the following fields.
    - height (integer) - The height of the matrix.
    - image (array) - A matrix of size `height` x `width` containing individual values of type float. Each value is the distance in millimeters from the sensor for each pixel in the captured image. For example, if you point the sensor at a flat wall 2 meters away, most of the values in the matrix should be around `2000`. Note that as the robot moves further away from a scene being viewed, each pixel value will represent a larger surface area. Conversely, if it moves closer, each pixel value would represent a smaller area.
    - width (integer) - The width of the matrix.

```json
{
  "height": 240,
  "image": [857.2632,853.8426,847.1372...],
  "width": 320
}
```

### SlamStartStreaming - ALPHA

**Important!** Always use `SlamStopStreaming` to close the depth sensor data stream after sending commands that use Misty's Occipital Structure Core depth sensor. Using `SlamStopStreaming` turns off the laser in the depth sensor and lowers Misty's power consumption. Note that Misty's 4K camera may not work while the depth sensor data stream is open.

Endpoint: POST &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/slam/streaming/start

Parameters 
- None

Return Values
- Result (boolean) - Returns `true` if there are no errors related to this command.

### SlamStopStreaming - ALPHA
Closes the data stream from the Occipital Structure Core depth sensor. This command turns off the laser in the depth sensor and lowers Misty's power consumption.

**Important!** Always use this command to close the depth sensor data stream after using `SlamStartStreaming` and any commands that use Misty's Occipital Structure Core depth sensor. Note that Misty's 4K camera may not work while the depth sensor data stream is open.

Endpoint: POST &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/slam/streaming/stop

Parameters
- None

Return Values
- Results (boolean) - Returns `true` if there are no errors related to this command.

## Locomotion

The following commands allow you to programmatically drive and stop Misty. If you want to directly drive Misty, you can use her [companion app](../../../docs/apps/companion-app).

To programmatically obtain live data streams back from Misty that include movement, position, and proximity data, you can [subscribe](../../build/remote-command-architecture#subscribing-amp-unsubscribing-to-a-websocket) to her LocomotionCommand, HaltCommand, TimeOfFlight, and SelfState [WebSockets](../../reference/sensor-data). To directly observe this data, you can use the [API Explorer](../../../docs/apps/api-explorer/#opening-a-websocket).

### Drive
Drives Misty forward or backward at a specific speed until cancelled.

When using the Drive command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Endpoint: POST &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/drive

Parameters
- LinearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
- AngularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note:** For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.

```json
{
  "LinearVelocity": 20,
  "AngularVelocity": 15,
}
```

Return Values
* Result (boolean) - Returns `true` if there are no errors related to this command.


### DriveTime
Drives Misty forward or backward at a set speed, with a given rotation, for a specified amount of time.

When using the DriveTime command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

For a step-by-step mapping exercise, see the instructions with the [API Explorer](../../../docs/apps/api-explorer/#mapping-amp-tracking-alpha).

**Note:** If you are mapping with a **Misty I** or **Misty II prototype**, please be aware of the following:
* The USB cable connecting the headboard to the Occipital Structure Core depth sensor is known to fail in some Misty prototypes. This can cause intermittent or non-working mapping and localization functionality.
* Misty prototypes can only create and store one map at a time, and a map must be created in a single mapping session.
* Mapping a large room with many obstacles can consume all of the memory resources on the processor used for mapping and crash the device.
* Some Misty I and some Misty II prototypes may generate inaccurate maps due to depth sensor calibration flaws.

### SlamGetRawMap - ALPHA

Obtains occupancy grid data for the most recent map Misty has generated. **Note:** To obtain a valid response from `SlamGetRawMap`, Misty must first have successfully generated a map. 

Misty’s maps are squares that are constructed around her initial physical location when she starts mapping. When a map is complete, it is a square with Misty’s starting point at the center.

The occupancy grid for the map is represented by a two-dimensional matrix. Each element in the occupancy grid represents an individual cell of space. The value of each element (0, 1, 2, or 3) indicates the nature of the space in those cells (respectively: “unknown", “open", “occupied", or “covered").

Each cell corresponds to a pair of X,Y coordinates that you can use with the `FollowPath`, `DriveToLocation`, and `SlamGetPath` commands. The first cell in the first array of the occupancy grid is the origin point (0,0) for the map. The X coordinate of a given cell is the index of the array for the cell. The Y coordinate of a cell is the index of that cell within its array. 

Endpoint: &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/slam/map/raw 

or 

&lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/slam/map 

Parameters
 * None

Return Values
* Result (object) - An object containing the following key-value pairs:
  * grid (array of arrays) - The occupancy grid for the most recent map Misty has generated, represented by a matrix of cells. The number of arrays is equal to the value of the `height` parameter. The number of cells is equal to the product of `height` x `width`. Each individual value (0, 1, 2, or 3) in the matrix represents a single cell of space. 0 indicates “unknown" space, 1 indicates “open" space, 2 indicates “occupied" space, and 3 indicates “covered" space. Each cell corresponds to an X,Y coordinate on the occupancy grid. The first cell in the first array is the X,Y origin point (0,0) for the map. The X coordinate of a given cell is the index of the array for the cell. The Y coordinate of a cell is the index of that cell within its array. If no map is available, grid returns `null`.
  * height (integer) - The height of the occupancy grid matrix (in number of cells).
  * isValid (boolean) - Returns a value of `true` if the data returned represents a valid map. If no valid map data is available, returns a value of `false`.
  * metersPerCell (integer) - A value in square meters stating the size of each cell in the occupancy grid matrix.
  * originX (float) - The distance in meters from the X value of the occupancy grid origin (0,0) to the X coordinate of the physical location where Misty started mapping. The X,Y coordinates of Misty's starting point are always at the center of the occupancy grid. To convert this value to an X coordinate on the occupancy grid, use the formula 0 - (`originX` / `metersPerCell`). Round the result to the nearest whole number. 
  * originY (float) - The distance in meters from the Y value of the occupancy grid origin (0,0) to the Y coordinate of the physical location where Misty started mapping. The X,Y coordinates of Misty's starting point are always at the center of the occupancy grid. To convert this value to a Y coordinate on the occupancy grid, use the formula 0 - (`originY` / `metersPerCell`). Round the result to the nearest whole number. 
  * size (integer) - The total number of map cells represented in the grid array. Multiply this number by the value of meters per cell to calculate the area of the map in square meters.
  * width (integer) - The width of the occupancy grid matrix (in number of cells). 

### SlamGetPath - ALPHA

Obtain a path from Misty’s current location to a specified set of X,Y coordinates. Pass the waypoints this command returns to the path parameter of `FollowPath` for Misty to follow this path to the desired location.

**Note:** `SlamGetRawMap` obtains the occupancy grid for the most recent map Misty has generated. Use this grid to determine the X and Y coordinates of the destination. The X coordinate of a given cell is the index of the array for the cell. The Y coordinate of a cell is the index of that cell within its array. 

**Important!** Make sure to use `SlamStartTracking` before using this command to have Misty start tracking her location, and use `SlamStopTracking` to have her stop tracking her location after she arrives at the specified location.

Endpoint: GET &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/slam/path

Endpoint: POST &lt;robot-ip-address&gt;/api/alpha/serialport

Parameters

* Message (string) - The data Misty sends to the UART serial port, passed as a string value.

```json
{
  "Message": "your-data"
}
```

Return Values

- Result (boolean) - Returns `true` if no errors related to this request.
